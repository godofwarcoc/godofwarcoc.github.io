            It's a commity, isn't it? A commity is in need of powerfull players who will control it and will guide you
            to make it better. Here is a list of players who will guide you and this clan. If any player misuses his/her
            power, just <a href="mailto:rehanakon009@gmail.com">Report</a> to me (your clan Leader). I'll take that
            subject in my concern. Happy clashing lads!
