        <div class="uni" id="warrules">
            <div class="uni-title">War Rules</div>
            You can not win a war wihout following the commands of your commander. At GoW, Dark Hawk is your commander
            of war. He has experience of winning about 554 war stars. Follow his commands to win a war. Additional
            instructions by Dark Hawk : <br>

            <ol type="1">
                <li>Make your war base stronger.</li>
                <li>Scout enemy war base more and more and plan your attack strategy.</li>
                <li>Your first attack is mirror attack.</li>
                <p>Q: What is mirror attack? <br> A: Mirror attack is attacking the opponent who is standing exactly in front
                    of you. Let me give you an example to make it clear. Suppose your position in war is No.12 and if you
                    attack enemy No.12 , it will be called mirror attack. <br> </p>
                <li>Wait for second attack instruction from your commander.</li>
                <li>Don't attack an enemy where your clanmate has already destructed 100%.</li>
                <li>Don't spoil others attack.</li>
                <li>You don't need to donate in war base clan castle. Your commander has the idea.</li>
                <li>No attack will cause no participation in upcoming two wars.</li>
            </ol>
